# **Stan's Plan**

**The Beginning:**  All summer long I have been watching the news, horrified by our President and the Republican Congress, and asking myself "What can I do?".  At first, other than voting, there isn't much I can do.  My only other tool has been contributing to candidates I like.  In the past I've made modest contributions to Democrats in my districts, but living in California those candidates win anyway.  

So I thought about the problem:  *How can I donate effectively?*  



**Objective:** To gain Democratic control of the US House and Senate.



**The Plan:**  After rejecting many complicated ideas, my final plan seemed so simple:

1. Make equal contributions to every Democratic candidate running for the US House of Representatives where the race is a *Toss Up*.  There are 30 such races (including 12 female candidates).
2. Make equal contributions to every Democratic candidate running for the US Senate where the race is a *Toss Up*  or  *Leaning Republican*  or  *Likely Republican*.  11 races (including 5 female candidates).

Fortunately there is a non-partisan group that analyzes elections: *The Cook Political Report*.  Learn how each race is currently categorized:

-  House:   <https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings>
-  Senate:  <https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings> 

 

**Doing the work:** After a great deal of Googling, I compiled my list of the "Toss up" candidates and links to their donation pages.  Fortunately all Democrats use the same site for receiving donations, <www.ActBlue.com>.  I made my 41 individual contributions through Act Blue by following each of the candidate's Donate link.  

Many of my friends liked my plan and wanted to do it too, but were intimidated by all the work.  Using the Act Blue site, I figured out how to link all the "Toss up" candidates to a single page, making it easy to place a donation that is automatically divided 41 ways.  

Here's my plan all rolled into one spot:  <https://secure.actblue.com/donate/stansplan>.  All the funds go directly into the individual candidate's accounts (Act Blue uses 3.95% to pay the credit card fees).

 

**How much to give:** This is a very personal question that everyone needs to answer themselves.  I gave a total of $2255 ($55 to each candidate).  Even donating just $41 lets you put your finger on the scale of 41 races that could go either way.  

|  $41  | $1 per candidate  |
| :---: | :---------------: |
| $205  | $5 per candidate  |
| $410  | $10 per candidate |
| $1025 | $25 per candidate |

 

**Who is Stan:** I am an engineer, an entrepreneur, a college lecturer, and a father concerned about the country my daughter will inherit.  I'm a regular guy.  Other than voting and making small donations, I don't have a very political past.
